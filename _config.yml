  OpenICE is an initiative to create a community implementation of the ASTM F-2761
  standard for the Integrated Clinical Environment.  The initiative encompasses
  not only software implementation of those functionalities described in the standard
  but also an architecture for a wider clinical ecosystem that incorporates seamless
  connectivity to increase patient safety.  OpenICE seeks to provide a framework for
  the inclusion of healthcare devices and systems into the broader Internet of Things
  and Industrial Internet efforts.
